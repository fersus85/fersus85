### About

Worked as a store manager for 10 years. To automate tasks, I became interested in programming for reports. By this time, I already knew English quite well, which was a good start. I chose the path of self-study, without resorting to paid courses. Since then, I have come a long way and go further towards my goal. Сurrently looking for a project to work on. Always open to new acquaintances and proposals.
